	<h2>A livestyle blog by Alejandra Diaz</h2>

<p> Hello and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I am a University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez alumna with a degree in Business Administration. I was born and raised in a small town in the north west of the island. Moved to NYC to work and fell in love with the city and its people.</p>
