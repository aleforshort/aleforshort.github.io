<h1>Reflection</h1>
	<h2>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h2>
	<p>
	When I decided to start my own blog, two websites immediatly came to mind, <a href="https://www.cupcakesandcashmere.com">Cupcakes and Cashmere</a> and <a href="https://www.intothegloss.com">Into the Gloss</a>. These two websites are completely different in content and design. For me, Cupcakes and Cahsmere has that clean easy to read design while Into the Gloss has this cool it girl vibe. For my website, I plan on integrating both designs and create one with a clean visual flow and with cool accents that can be interesting and fun for my target readers. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h2>
	<p>
	In Units 5 and 6 we were paired with other students and I played designer role while Jillian was my client. Jillian wanted a website where she can sell clothes and accesories. In unit 6 we learned how to float items left an right and also how to create multiple columns in one single page. The feature I was the most proud of was the three columns layout of the pictures. The pictues gave color and served as action items in the web page. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h2>
	<p>
	Understanding the client needs and preferences in order to design a page that satifies both is probably the most challenging aspect of the design process. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h2>
	<p>
	Working with the float concept was challenging for me! I struggled a bit with the column alignment, but I practiced and asked for help from my mentor until I was finally able to figured out how to lay the columns next to each other. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h2>
	<p>
	Building a responsive website was very helpful because I now have a more clear understanding of how important flow and page layout is. For Jillian's shopping website I wanted customers to be able to see the images and the shopping navegation as action items for the customers as this was the main objective of the site. </p>

<h1>Reviews</h1>
	<h2>Build it Beautiful</h2>
	 <p>The layout of the Build it Beautiful website is one that captures the eye and is easy to follow. It starts from left to right, with the header on the left and bigger than the other texts and three imges demonstrating the site services. The typography works very well because it helps stand out the header with larger fonts and identifies the nav buttons with all caps. Once you click the nav buttons the linked pages are in different colors, which gives the site character. 
	</p>
	<h2>Mimarch</h2>
	<p>The layout and flow of Mimarch is not very clear for the readers. Readers can't easily identify the purpose of the site. Additionally, the typograhy is not the best as it took me some time to locate the nav buttoms on the top right. Also there are three navigation menus and you can't tell which one is the main navigation bar. Overall flow is misleading as the focal point is not clear if it is the items in motion on the top or the big pictures in the center of the page.
