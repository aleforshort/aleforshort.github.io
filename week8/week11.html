		<h2>The Brooklyn Flea Market</h2>
		<article>Me and two of my best girlfriends went to the Brooklyn Flea Market on the hunt for a floor mirror. It was our first time at the market and fell absolutely in love with the place! The market has everything from vintage furniture, jewelry, natural skin care products to food stations. Although we did not find the mirror at the price I wanted, and ended buying it at Ikea, we did treat ourselves with amazing home made turmeric almond milk and discovered a very talented and funny jewelry designer.

		<h2>Latest Beauty Buys</h2>
		<article>I am pretty sure that beauty obsessed girls like myself are big fans of the beauty website Into The Gloss. Well last month ITG founder Emily Weiss launched Glossier, a beauty line that provides skin essentials that claim to make you glow as soon as you put it on. So as a big fan I had to try it. The line has the option to buy the Phase 1 set bundle or each item individually. I have sensitive skin so, for now, I just bought the skin tint formula. I really like the product and how it easily blends in my face without feeling thick or clogging my pores. Now that I have tried tint I am ready to try the face mist, prime moisturizer and balm!
